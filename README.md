Very early stages of a program to drive a model rail layout.

Using the Hornby Elite DCC controller:

# python read.py
# cd redis
# python consumer.py 

Then open the www/index.html page in a browser, I linked it into /var/www

Then you can move the controller on the elite and see the slider move as loco 3 speeds up and slows down.

Loco 3 only at the moment
